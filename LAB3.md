# LAB3

1. Problem: Not many reads available for assembly                                  Solution: Use the unpaired reads to supplement
2. Problem: Per base sequence content is bad near the end of the fastq report      Solution: Trim the sequences
3. Problem: Sequence length is highly variable (35-251)                            Solution: Trim the sequences, set a MINLEN
4. Problem: Uneven distribution of nucleotides                                     Solution: I have no idea
